### Introduction:**
Employee Attrition is defined as the natural process by which employees leave the workforce – for example, through resignation for personal reasons or retirement – and are not immediately replaced. If the attrition becomes frequent, it poses a problem because;
    1. The HR team will spend more time and resources hiring and training new staff to fit into the company's culture. 
    2. Prospective employees will view the company in badlight, ranging from renumeration to work-life balance issues. 

### Problem statement:**
This project deepdives into the attrition data of a company to understand reasons why employees leave, predict those who're prone to leave and come up with strategies to mitigate this problem.

These variables were given in the data:
    1.    Satisfaction Level
    2.    Last Evaluation
    3.    Number of Projects
    4.    Average monthly hours (worked)
    5.    Time spent in the company (years)
    6.    Whether they have had promotion in the last 5 years
    7.    Department
    8.    Salary

### The following questions were answered by the project:
    1.    What type of employees are leaving the company?
    2.    Which employees of the company are prone to leaving next?

# **Insights from the Analysis**
### What type of employees are leaving?
    1. Those who weren’t promoted in the last 5 years
    2. Those whose are low to medium salary earners
    3. Those who belonged to a department whose functions had to do with dealing with clients
    4. Those who did too little or too much projects
    5. Those who had spent between 2-4 years in the company
    6. Those whose average monthly hours is below or above 175 - 225 hours

### Which employees are prone to leaving?
    1. Those who weren’t promoted in the last 5 years
    2. Those whose are low to medium salary earners
    3. Those who belonged to a department whose functions had to do with dealing with clients
    4. Those who are doing less or more than 3-5 projects
    5. Those who had spent between 3-5 years in the company
    6. Those whose average monthly hours is below or above 130 - 275 hours
    
# **Recommendations**
1. Employees should be given 3-5 projects to avoid decrease in satisfaction level
2. Faster promotions needs to be given to deserving employees
3. The average monthly hours for the employees should be between 130-275 hours to avoid under and over utilization
4. Better incentives and salary structures needs to be implemented to avoid decrease in satisfaction level
5. Retraining and incentives should be given to employees whose function has to do with dealing with clients
6. The company values and culture needs to be stated every now and then, so employees can have long term career plans in the company
